Project 1: ***A Number Guessing Game***

# Purpose of the project:

In this project, I have build a console game that let me practice the skills and concepts that I've learned in Unit 1:

	-For loops

	-While loops

	-Lists (appending and calling)

	-Math: Min, mean, mode, median

	-Formatting

# Description:

The game is played so that we ask the player to enter a number of his choosing. 

His job is to make a guess, and the game tells them whether his guess is too high or too low.
 
This version has an error handling feature where the game warns the player that his choice is out of range.

If they guess the right answer the game is done.

After the game is done, player of the game sees the following information:

	-number of attempts at guessing
	-the mean of the saved attempts list
	-the median of the saved attempts list
	-the mode of the saved attempts list
